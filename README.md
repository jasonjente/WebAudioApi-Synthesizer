# WebAudioApiSynth
A synthesizer using the Web Audio Api following the MVC design pattern in pure Javascript.
Version 2: Dockerised notes
  Install docker on your machine, as well as a unix style shell. I prefer WLS 2 with ubuntu.
  Run the script node-setup.sh and ta-dah, with the magic of dev-ops and automation your server will be up 
  and running in seconds delivering as a response the html file created in the previous commit.
  


Version 1 notes:
  Download the file index2.html  and open it with your browser
  or download index.html with script.js and open both of them on your IDE(like visual code or WebStorm and let it handle all the hosting work
  
  this is an example to demonstrate the simplicity of this library as it can be run straight from an html file
